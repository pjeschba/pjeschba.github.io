  <h2 class="text-center"> The Stranger by Albert Camus - Book Review</h2>
  <h5 class="text-center"> Written on: 2018-12-31</h5>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I finished this one in a day - the length and distinct segmentation into two
  parts made it natural to do so. I've heard Camus' name before and was expecting
  a headier, overtly philosophical novel; I'm surprised and pleased to say this
  wasn't one. There are lots of weighty philosophical themes, to be sure, but
  they are more embedded into the narrative structure rather than being a part of
  lengthy diatribes given by the characters. </p>
<p>All of the above, along with Camus'
  straightforward, bare bones writing style (in the vein of Hemingway,
  according to the American translation's foreword) makes the Stranger a very
  powerful book. It hits you in the face with its philosophical ideals and forces
  you to consider some very uncomfortable truths about human existence. Namely,
  what becomes of man when he appears to have absolutely no agency of his own?</p>
<h2>Some thoughts on self-agency and existentialism</h2>
<p>The constant tension throughout this book is Meursault's true desires
  <em>vis-a-vis</em> the forces in his life that drag him along, causing him to do one
  thing instead of another. Whether it's his mother dying, causing Meursault to
  have to take a long bus out to the country, his neighbors, beleaguering him
  with their problems, or the heat of France in the summertime, causing him to
  make a fateful choice that will impact the rest of his life, Meursault never
  really seems to do what it is that <strong>he</strong> truly wants to do - every decision
  he makes is the result of some external factor. Even his own explanation
  of the crime he is accused of in the second half of the book is wrested
  away from him, due to his general lack of charisma and the suspicious
  circumstances surrounding the crime. Camus questions
  how much agency we can really have in an absurd world where there are so many
  things that happen, seemingly at random, that are completely out of our
  control.</p>
<p>I'd heard of Camus being associated with the existentialist movement, which I think of as a movement centered around the self and how to live a meaningful life in
  a world that appears meaningless. This novel fits that definition of
  existentialism to a tee, despite the forces of life that compel Meursault
  forward. Even down to Meursault's last days, when almost all
  of his freedom has been taken, Camus still equips him with the drive and
  ability to make some choices, however small they are. </p>
